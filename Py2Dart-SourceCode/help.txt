1) Type the command on the shell after the '>>> ' mark, and it is assumed that the syntax is proper.
2) If a command is of multiple lines, then keep typing the lines one by one and end it with a "|" sign
	Eg: Say the for loop :
	>> Type - for i in range(5):
	# Now the translator will find out that this will span for multiple lines
	# and keep accepting the inputs each in a seperate line, until a new line
	# with only '$' sign is not present.
3) It is better to avoid nesting of loops and conditional statements since this tool is still in the beta stage, even though the working of these is done, but a successful output is not guaranteed.
4) Only one command or one block is allowed at a time.
5) Type 'help','developer_details' or 'exit' anytime the '>>> ' prompt arrives.
